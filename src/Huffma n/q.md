## 题目描述
Given N
integers, you are required to merge them into one single integer using N−1
operations. During each operation, you can choose two integers x
and y
and replace the two integers with one single integer x+y
, which costs x+y
power.

Now you wonder the minimum sum of power possible to complete the mission.
## 输入
The first line contains one integer N(1≤N≤5×105)

integers A1,A2,...AN(1≤Ai≤107)
, denoting the N
integers you are required to merge.
## 输出
Output one single integer indicating the minimum power to complete the mission.
