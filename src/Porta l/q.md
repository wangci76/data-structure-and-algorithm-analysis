## 题目描述
Yuki is a magical girl and she has the ability to activate portals.

The country Yuki lives in has n
cities and m
roads at certain distances. The cities are numbered from 1
to n
and all the roads are unidirectional, that is a road from u
to v
cannot be passed from v
to u
. Also, there are p
portals in the country, each of them connects two cities unidirectional with no distance. Since Yuki doesn't grasp magic thoroughly, she can activate at most k
portals.

Now Yuki is curious about what is the minimum distance between S
and T
if she activates at most k
portals.

## 输入
The first line contains four integers: n
, m
, p
and k
(1≤n,m,p≤50 000,0≤k≤10)
--- the number of cities, roads, portals and the number of portals Yuki can activate at most.

Each of the next m
lines contains three integers: u
, v
and w
(1≤u, v≤n,1≤w≤1 000 000)
, meaning that there is a unidirectional road from city u
to city v
at distance w
.

Each of the next p
lines contains two integer: u
and v
(1≤u, v≤n)
, meaning that there is an inactive portal from city u
to city v
. Please note that when it is active, Yuki can only be teleported from city u
to v
unidirectionally.

The last line contains two integers: S
and T
(1≤S,T≤n)
--- the origin and destination.

## 输出
Print one line with the result --- the minimum distance between city S
and T
.

It is guaranteed that Yuki can move from city S
to T
by activating at most k
portals.
