## 题目描述
Given a tree whose nodes are numbered from 1 to n
. You are asked to print all the leaf nodes of the tree in ascending order. The root of the tree is node 1.
## 输入
The first line contains one integer n
(1≤n≤1 000 000)
, indicating the number of nodes in the tree.

Then n−1
lines follow. Each line contains two integers u,v
(1≤u,v≤n)
describing an edge, indicating the indices of nodes which form an edge.
## 输出
One line contains integers in ascending order.Multiple integers in one line must be separated by one space.
