## 题目描述
There is a complete binary tree, and you will get the number of nodes in this tree. You are asked to find the height of the tree.

Notice that the height of a leaf node is 1
, and the height of any other nodes equals the maximum height among all subtrees plus one. And the height of a tree equals the height of the root node in the tree.
## 输入
The first line contains one integer T
(1≤T≤100 000)
, which denotes the number of the test cases.

Then T
lines follow. Each line contains an integer num
(1≤num≤1018)
, which denotes number of the nodes in this tree.

## 输出
T
lines. Each line contains one integer denotes the height of the tree in that case.
