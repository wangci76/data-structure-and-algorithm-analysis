## 题目描述
Give you the in-order and post-order traversal of a binary tree T
. Please find the pre-order traversal of T
.
## 输入
First line is an integer Q
, which is the number of test cases. (1<=Q<=50
)

There are three lines in each test case.

The first line contains only one integer N
(1<=N<=1024
), which is the number of nodes of tree T
. Also, the nodes are numbered from 1 to N
.

The second line is the in-order traversal of the tree T
.

The third line is the post-order traversal of the tree T
.
## 输出
For each test case, ouput one line, representing the pre-order traversal of the tree.
