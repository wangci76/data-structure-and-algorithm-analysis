## 题目描述
Given a sequence {a1,a2,...,an}
 with n
 numbers.

Please output the double of the median of {a}
.

The definition of the median: Assume m
 is the median of {a}
:
if n
 is odd, then 2m=2an+12
;
if n
 is even, then 2m=an2+an2+1
## 输入
The first line is an integer n


The second line will be n
 integers: a1,a2,...,an


For all cases, 1≤n≤5∗106
, 0≤ai≤2147483647

## 输出
Output one integer indicates the double of the median.
## 样例输入
6
3 2 1 4 5 6
## 样例输出
7
## 提示
In the sample case, the median is 3.5, so the answer is 3.5 * 2 = 7
