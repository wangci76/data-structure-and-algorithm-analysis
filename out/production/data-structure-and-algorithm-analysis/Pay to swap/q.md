## 题目描述
Given a random sequence {a}
 with n
 distinct elements. You can swap two adjacent elements each time, and the cost is the smaller one. You want to know the minimum cost to sort the sequence to a ascending sequence.

For example, if you swap (ai,ai+1)
, then the cost of this operation is min(ai,ai+1)

## 输入
The first line of the input contains one integer n
.

The second line contains n
 integers a1,a2,...,an
.

For all cases, 1≤n≤105,0≤ai≤109

## 输出
Output one integer indicates the minimum cost.
