## 题目描述
Given F(x) = xex/20 - b, (x ϵ R, e is a constant approximately equal to 2.718281828459, also known as Euler number , b is a given integer).

Please find the zero point of F(x) .

## 输入
The 1st line is a positive integer T(1⩽T⩽1000)
which is the number of test cases.

Then T
lines follow. Each line has an integer b(1⩽b⩽108)
for a test case.
## 输出
Output T
lines. Each line contains a number ans
(accurate up to 10 decimal places), representing the approximate zero point of F(x)
and |F(ans)|<0.01
.
